  About us
  <hr>
</p>

<pre style='font-size:16px;'>   Founded in 1922, Holy Cross Home was Ida Dickenson  initiative to provide shelter and an environment of love and care to homeless children.
   In December 1927, when she could no more manage the work, the Bishop of Bombay requested the Daughters of the Cross to take over her work.<br>
   The charism of the Daughters of the Cross is to reach out to the weakest and most suffering members of society.
   Over nine decades of working with and for the girls, the ultimate goal of Holy Cross Home is empowering deprived, underprivileged and young children
   to be confident, qualified, responsible, value based citizens of our country.
